# F2-Contest-1st-March
Project Overview
Task:
Create a webpage that prompts the user to enter two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) and displays the result of the corresponding arithmetic operation on the numbers entered.
For example, if the user enters "5" and "3" as the numbers and "+" as the operator, the result displayed should be "8". If the user enters "10" and "2" as the numbers and "/" as the operator, the result displayed should be "5". Make sure to handle cases where the input values are not valid (e.g. if they are not numbers or if the operator entered is not one of the four valid operators).

Requirements
Now you have already been given a simple starter code to start with. You don’t need to worry about what is happening in the index.html. Everything will work on its own. All you need to do is go to the script.js and edit the calculate() function. The function has 3 parameters that we’re passing. The first one is num1, the second is num2 and the third is the operator.


The task is that - you have to Use if-else statements to determine which arithmetic operation to perform based on the operator entered. In the function you need to return the final value that you get after operating on num1 and num2 based on what the operator is. So for example if operator == "+" then return num1+num2 , else if operator == "-" then return num1-num2 and so on....


So at the end, all you need to do is write a simple if else block and based on what the operator is you need to perform that operation and return that value. All of the validations have been done for you already. Just handle the if else block. And if the operator is none of the above then you need to return nothing. return null.


To get started - download the 2 files - (don't clone the repo) just download the two files and push the code in a different repo and host it.
